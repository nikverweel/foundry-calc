## Information
This is the repository for a new standalone FOUNDRY calculator, available [here](#). This tool can be used for calculating resource requirements and production ratios for the game [FOUNDRY](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/foundry/about).


## Running locally
The calculator consists of static files (HTML, CSS, JS). Some additional tools are available in the form of R scripts. To run the calculator locally, you can do so using any HTTP server. If you have Python3 installed, you can start a simple development server on port 8000 using:

```
$ python3 -m http.server 8000
```

## Issues
Any bugs, issues or suggestions can be raised [here](https://github.com/nikverweel/foundry-calc/issues). Note that this project is still in development, and a lot of planned functionalities are yet to be added.
